ent-RMCHelmetGarbFlechette = spent flechette

    .desc = { ent-RMCHelmetGarbGasmask.desc }

ent-RMCHelmetGarbFeatherPurple = lucky purple feather
    .desc = It is a plucky purple color. Legend has it a station AI known as Shakespeare simulated 1000 monkeys typing gibberish in order to replicate the actual works of Shakespeare. Art critics are on the fence if this is the first instance of true artificial abstract art.
ent-RMCHelmetGarbFeatherYellow = lucky yellow feather

    .desc = Jesus Saves Lives!
ent-RMCHelmetGarbPrescription = prescription medication
    .desc = Anti-anxiety meds? Amphetamines? The cure for Sudden Sleep Disorder? The label can't be read, leaving the now absent contents forever a mystery. The cap is screwed on tighter than any ID lock.
