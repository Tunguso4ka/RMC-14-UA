ent-RMCBeakerHighCapacity = high-capacity beaker
    .desc = A beaker with an enlarged holding capacity, made with blue-tinted plexiglass in order to withstand greater pressure. Can hold up to 300 units.
ent-CMMiniTank = MS-11 розумний заправочний контейнер
    .desc = A robust little tank capable of refilling autoinjectors that previously required a nanomed system to refill. Using the wonders of microchips, it automatically sorts the correct chemicals into most single reagent autoinjectors. It is unable to partially fill them however. A valve exists on the top to transfer reagents to another container or to flush it entirely.
