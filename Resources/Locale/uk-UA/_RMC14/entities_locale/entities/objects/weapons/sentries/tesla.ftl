ent-RMCBaseTesla = { ent-BaseItem }
    .desc = { ent-BaseItem.desc }
ent-RMCTesla = UN 21S tesla coil
    .desc = A perfected way of producing high-voltage, low-current and high-frequency electricity. Minor modifications allow it to only hit hostile targets with a devastating shock.
ent-RMCTeslaMicro = UN 25S micro tesla coil
    .desc = A perfected way of producing high-voltage, low-current and high-frequency electricity. Minor modifications allow it to only hit hostile targets with a devastating shock. This one is smaller and more lightweight.
ent-RMCTeslaOverclocked = UN 21S overclocked tesla coil
    .desc = A perfected way of producing high-voltage, low-current and high-frequency electricity. Minor modifications allow it to only hit hostile targets with a devastating shock. This one is significantly overclocked, providing a lot more voltage at the cost of speed.
