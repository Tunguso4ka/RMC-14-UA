ent-RMCBarrelAttachmentBase = { ent-RMCAttachmentBase }
    .desc = { ent-RMCAttachmentBase.desc }

ent-RMCAttachmentExtendedBarrel = extended barrel
    .desc = The lengthened barrel speeds up and stabilizes the bullet, increasing velocity.

ent-RMCAttachmentBarrelCharger = barrel charger
    .desc = The lengthened barrel speeds up and stabilizes the bullet, increasing velocity.

ent-RMCAttachmentRecoilCompensator = recoil compensator
    .desc = A muzzle attachment that reduces recoil by diverting expelled gasses upwards. Reduces recoil, at the cost of a small amount of weapon damage.

ent-RMCAttachmentSuppressor = suppressor
    .desc = A small tube with exhaust ports to expel noise and gas. Does not completely silence a weapon, but does make it much quieter and a little more accurate and stable at the cost of slightly reduced damage.
