    .desc = { ent-RMCAttachableBase.desc }
ent-RMCAttachmentExtendedBarrel = extended barrel
    .desc = The lengthened barrel speeds up and stabilizes the bullet, increasing velocity.

ent-RMCAttachmentBarrelMar50 = MAR-50 barrel
    .desc = A heavy barrel.
ent-RMCAttachmentBarrelCharger = barrel charger
    .desc = The lengthened barrel speeds up and stabilizes the bullet, increasing velocity.

ent-RMCAttachmentRecoilCompensator = recoil compensator
    .desc = A muzzle attachment that reduces recoil by diverting expelled gasses upwards. Reduces recoil, at the cost of a small amount of weapon damage.

ent-RMCAttachmentSuppressor = suppressor
    .desc = A small tube with exhaust ports to expel noise and gas. Does not completely silence a weapon, but does make it much quieter and a little more accurate and stable at the cost of slightly reduced damage.
ent-RMCAttachmentSuppressorXM40 = XM40 suppressor
    .desc = A small tube with exhaust ports to expel noise and gas. Does not completely silence a weapon, but does make it much quieter at the cost of slightly reduced damage.
ent-RMCAttachmentMatebaStandard = Standard Mateba Barrel
    .desc = A standard mateba barrel. Offers a balance between accuracy and fire rate.
