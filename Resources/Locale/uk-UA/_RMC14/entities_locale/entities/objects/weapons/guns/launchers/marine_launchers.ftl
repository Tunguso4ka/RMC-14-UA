    The M5 Anti-Tank Launcher is a powerful anti-armor infantry weapon, commonly fielded by the UNMC. Used to take out light-tanks and enemy structures, the M5-ATL is a dangerous weapon with a variety of combat uses, depending on the loaded ammunition, and is capable of firing both shells and rocket-propelled grenades.
