ent-RMCCommunicationsTower = TC-3T телекомукаційна башта
    .desc = A static heavy-duty TC-3T telecommunications tower. Used to set up subspace communications lines between planetary and extra-planetary locations. Will need to have extra communication frequencies programmed into it by multitool.

    .suffix = Two
ent-RMCCommunicationsTowerProp = destroyed comms tower
    .desc = An old company comms tower used to transmit communications between subspace bodies. Looks like this one has seen better days.
